# hello-world
Just another repository

Hi humans!

## Greeting from me
I am here. I am Indonesian girl who have learned Computer Science for more than 10 years. However, if you ask me, "Are you expert in coding?". I would say, "No". Why? I don't know too. LOL!

Let's say, I have a brain memory disorder. It makes me hard to focus, remember, and understand something too logical. As a result, I am more into analyst thing and do not really understand about coding stuff. 

## So, why I am here? 
Because I want to. And I need to. LOL. 

Last year (2020), I graduated from Master program at Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan. Then, I got my first job at Malaysian Start Up called A Job Thing as Software Quality Assurance (SQA). I joined Mobile App Team who are people behind MauKerja and RiceBowl application.

At first, my job is more into QA Analyst because we didn't have a proper test management at that time. Then, I started to work on manual testing for Android and iOS platform. And the story began ...

## Moving from manual to automation
Because I work in small start up and we are still lack of man power, I need to do all the things related Software Testing for my team. Let's say, QA full stack. After learning how work with QA Analyst and Manual Testing stuff, I still struggle to finish my works. You can understand by trying to use our apps. A thousand of bugs! LOL.

If you asked me, "What is your effort to do your job?" I would say, "A lot!". I started to learn from zero, literally zero. I read so many articles about Software Testing, follow many LinkedIn and YouTube Channel that explain about that. I also joined many webinar class about Software Testing and Product Development every month. Trial and error using different kind of Software Testing tools, such as Selenium, Cucumber, Appium, Robot Framework, Mocha, and TestProject. But still fail. LOL. 

Sometimes I feel like incapable doing this thing, feeling guilty, and feeling useless. But sometimes, I feel like very angry and want a revenge, I want to master it and be expertise in this area! 

One reference that help me a lot to understand about Software Testing is https://www.guru99.com/software-testing.html. Many thanks to the author and the team. I believe you help a lot of people who struggle to learn Testing stuff. Including me :D

Right now, I am still in this phase
- Testing Fundamental
- Types of Testing
- Test Case Development
- Testing Techniques
- Test Management and Control
- Defect

You know what? All of them are more into QA Analyst and Manual Testing. It's really great fundamental for SQA. But still, a long journey to be QA Engineer or SDET that I need. So, that's why I want to break my limitation. Do not care about stigma and other's question, "After 10 years in IT field, why is so hard to do this?"



**Start from small steps. Only need 1% better improvement each day.**



To be honest, I want to encourage anyone that maybe have similar condition or feeling to keep going, especially girl or woman. Thanks to one of my supervisor from III Taiwan that encouraged me even if I  had zero knowledges about Cloud Infrastructure that time, "Keep going and growing. Time will prove".

Thank you for reading, my first Hello World on Github!

Sincerely,
